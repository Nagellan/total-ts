// Explain autocomplete and type checking

/**
 * Autocomplete happens when user modifies code, typescript server watches the changes,
 * analyzes the modified code, looks at the types behind that code and its constructions,
 * checks possible constructions use and suggests them to be applied to the code.
 *
 * Type checking analyzes the provided code on possible mistakes. The code constructions
 * are checked on accordance to the type system rules. If there are any errors or warnings,
 * they are shown to the user.
 */

// Check your types are correct across your whole application

/**
 * Taking into account that this directory is my whole application for now,
 * I have run the following command:
 *
 * ```
 * node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc
 * ```
 *
 * I have got the following output summary:
 * "Found 297 errors in 151 files."
 */

// Refactor with confidence

/**
 * I will, thanks
