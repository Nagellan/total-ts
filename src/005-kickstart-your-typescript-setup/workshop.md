Discuss each of the questions below in your groups.

### How is TypeScript different to JavaScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
It provides the JavaScript some syntax sugar as well as a powerful type system.
TypeScript makes it possible to access autocomplete, symbol refactoring, going
to the references and much more. But what's more important: code written in
TypeScript is more safe and understandable. While it may be a bit harder and
slower to write a TypeScript code compared to JavaScript, TypeScript makes us
more confident about what we write, its safety and provides us more opportunities
to work with the code and check it.

### Can you turn TypeScript into JavaScript?

Of course yes. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it's possible if
the code is correctly written.

### What kind of mistakes does TypeScript help prevent?

The common mistakes are: renaming variables across all project, variable
types mismatch and others.

### Does TypeScript make your code run faster?

It does actually depend on the tooling that is used to transpile TypeScript code
into the JavaScript and other code processing tools. It's possible to make it run
faster or the same or even slower that the provided JavaScript sample.

By the way, the existence of a transpilation stage slows down the development process
but may or may not influence the overall code run speed.

### What is a 'type'?

Type is an interface that describes the provided code constructions.
It describes mostly constraints and overall that this construction is about.
