// Explain diagram

/**
 * The diagram shows the complete development cycle: from writing the code
 * and to the code processing. The process starts from the IDE that provides
 * us the interface for accessing, creating and modifying the code.
 * Then this code is transformed from TypeScript into the JavaScript by
 * the TypeScript CLI in order to make it possible to run the written code.
 * Finally, code in JavaScript is then run by the JavaScript runtime
 * environment. This process repeats over and over again in the development
 * loop that happens while the project is being developed.
