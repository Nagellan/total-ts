// Explain diagram

/**
 * the JavaScript-only diagram shows that the code written by user in JS
 * may then be run directly at the JS runtime environments: browser or nodejs.
 *
 * the TypeScript diagram is different from the JavaScript-only diagram,
 * because the code written by user cannot be run directly at the JS runtime
 * environments, because it's not JS! There have to be an additional process
 * that transforms code in TypeScript into the code on JavaScript, and only then
 * this code may be run. Having an additional process, we pay an extra for
 * the opportunity to access the powerful type system that helps to write
 * a better and safer code.
