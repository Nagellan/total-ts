// Explain prettier

/**
 * Prettier formats files instead of user's manual edits.
 * It uses a configurations file or its default configurations and applies
 * those formatting rules into the code on some trigger action such as
 * manual command run or format on save action.
 */

// Explain how to set up prettier

/**
 * In order to work, prettier needs to be installed either globally or in workspace.
 * After the installation, you can access the prettier command in terminal and just use
 * the cli to format the files. You may also set up a prettier configuration file in order
 * to define same formatting rules for the whole repository, especially for those
 * working on it not alone. If you use VSCode, you can install Prettier extension to
 * access features integrated into an IDE, such as save on format.
 */

// Explain how to set up formatOnSave

/**
 * To set up formatOnSave, the one need to open VSCode settings, type formatOnSave to
 * the searchbox, and check the checkbox.
